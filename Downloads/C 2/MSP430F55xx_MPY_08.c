 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F552x Demo - 8x8 Signed Multiply Accumulate
//
//   Description: Hardware multiplier is used to multiply two numbers.
//   The calculation is automatically initiated after the second operand is
//   loaded.  A second multiply accumulate operation is performed after that.
//   Results are stored in RESLO and RESHI.  SUMEXT contains the extended sign of
//   result.
//   ACLK = 32.768kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
