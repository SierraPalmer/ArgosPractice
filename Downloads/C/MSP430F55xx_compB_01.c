 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

// MSP430x552x Demo - COMPB output Toggle in LPM4; Vcompare is compared against  
//                    the internal 2.0V reference
//
// Description: Use CompB and internal reference to determine if input'Vcompare'
//    is high of low.  When Vcompare exceeds 2.0V CBOUT goes high and when 
//    Vcompare is less than 2.0V then CBOUT goes low. 
//    Connect P1.6/CBOUT to P1.0 externally to see the LED toggle accordingly.
//
